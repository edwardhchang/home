      content="Hi, my name is Eddie! I am a detail-oriented, analytical, and adaptable data scientist, interested in using data-driven approaches from a top-down perspective to create solutions for global problems. Having grown up in a small-business family and having worked in business financing at PayPal, I find data can drive improved business decisions and uncover areas of improved efficiency. Meticulous in many aspects when it comes to deliverables, I aim to find simple answers to multi-tiered problems and have a proven track record of doing so in high-pressure environments. As a recent graduate of General Assembly's Immersive Data Science camp, I am seeking a role with an organization where I can  collaborate with a team on difficult problems to provide simple and effective results to clients."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
